# lambda_workflow
This small repo contains the source code for a sample lambda function that was used in the post 
https://esciencegroup.com/2019/06/27/scientific-workflow-in-the-cloud-using-serverless-functions/

If you use it you will need to add a special lambda layer that contains the sklearn libraries and the simplified trained model used in the post.
